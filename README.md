# Live Data Map Visualization Application
The program includes the following:
﻿The ability to load and visualize Earthquake Data from RSS Feed﻿﻿﻿﻿ in the form of markers on the map and changing their color to represent that the earthquake's depth is shallow, moderate or intense and size of marker increases or decreases due to magnitude of earthquake. The ability to load and visualize City data in the form of markers on the map.
Both types of markers have clickable functionality where if an earthquake marker is clicked, the program hides all the markers that represents earthquakes and cities except the City Markers that falls in the Threat circle of said Earthquake Marker also plotting a line from the earthquake to said City and if a City Marker is clicked, all Markers gets hidden except the Earthquakes Markers that the City falls in their Threat circle and clicking anywhere in either situation, un-hides all the markers back to their original state.
     Ability to Filter Earthquake data based on Magnitude & Depth using an upper limit, lower limit, exact or ranged limit Filtering Parameters by Making Filtering classes that implements Predicate<T> interface of Java SE 8 to test whether a given entry is applicable to the Filtering condition or not.

    Ability to Load Live Earthquake Data from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/ by making my own Parser Classes ﻿& POJO classes to represent entries of different types all made possible by and Xerces XML Parser library.
    Added Airports Map that shows Airport Data as Markers and have clickable functionality of showing Routes of th﻿e clicked on airport to all destination airports as Lines, hiding all the other markers except the destination ones and clicking again anywhere will un-hide all markers and hide the route lines, ﻿all Made possible by making my own Airport Parser using Apache's CSVParser and AirportEntry POJO.
    Added Menu Bar as seen in Screenshot that provides functionalities such as Changing map from Earthquake Map to City Map, Airports Map or Life Expectancy Map, also the ability to change input source of data for earthquakes to be a local file by opening a javaFX File chooser or by selecting to load live data  from earthquake.usgs.gov including last hour, last day, last week, last month and also the ability to change the Map Provider to either road map, hybrid or aerial.
    Customized the Marker's looks where the last-hour & last-day age earthquakes are animated as radiating circles in case of Land Quakes and radiating Rounded-rectangles in case of Ocean Quakes with no fill, just a stroke and of opacity not solid color using processing's library color method and PGraphics renderer to produce my own customized Marker, also used a Pin icon for City Markers as shown in the Screenshot.
    Embedding Processing in a JavaFX Application using Processing 3.0+ version.
