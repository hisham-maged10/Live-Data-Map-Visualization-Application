 - The **Ability** to **load** and **visualize** Earthquake Data from **USGS's RSS feed** in the **form of Markers** from **USGS** [https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/) as **Live data** including **last hour, last day, last week** and **last month** options or **locally** from your **PC** using a file chooser.
 - The **Ability** to **filter** **data** based on either or both **magnitude** and **depth** criteria with an **upper limit**, **lower limit**, **exact** ***(uses exact floating point comparison)*** or **ranged** filters **on loading of data or anytime after loading data**.
 - **Changing the Earthquake markers' color dynamically** based on their **depth** producing a **light blue** color for **shallow** depth, **yellow** for **moderate** and **red** for **intense**.
 - The **Increase** or **decrease** of marker's **size** dynamically based on **magnitude**.
 - **Representation** of **Earthquakes** changing their **shape** based on **where they occurred** where quakes that happened on **land** are in the form of **circles**, while on **ocean** is in the form of **rounded rectangles**.
 - **Animation** on the **size** of markers if they **occurred** in the **past hour/day** where they appear in **radiating motion**.
 - **Showing** **information** about the marker on **mouse hover** in the form of **"magnitude, depth, description about its location, age".**
 - **Clicking** **on** an Earthquake **Marker**, **hides** all **markers** on map **except** the **City** markers that are in its **Threat circle aka Epicenter**, **Plotting** a **line** between the **Earthquake** and the **city or cities it might affect**.
